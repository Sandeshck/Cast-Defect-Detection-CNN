# Cast-Defect-Detection-Ml
The Cast Defect Detection project focuses on automating the inspection process of castings in the manufacturing industry using machine learning. The primary objective is to develop a reliable system that can accurately identify defects in castings, ensuring quality control and reducing the need for manual inspection.


## Features
- **Automate Defect Detection:** Develop a model that can identify defects in castings from images, automating the quality control process.
- **Improve Quality Control:** Ensure that defective products are identified and filtered out before they reach the customer, enhancing product quality.
- **Increase Efficiency:** Reduce the time and labor required for manual inspection, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the manufacturing process.

## Dataset
The dataset used for the Cast Defect Detection project consists of images of castings that are categorized as either defective or non-defectiveThis dataset, once preprocessed and augmented, is used to train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify images of castings into defective and non-defective categories.

## Prerequisites
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and organization.
  - Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing data.
  - Seaborn: For creating attractive and informative statistical graphics
  - OpenCV: For image processing tasks such as reading, resizing, and augmenting images.
  - TensorFlow/Keras: For building, training, and evaluating the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
  - Scikit-learn: For splitting the data into training and validation sets, and for evaluation metrics. 

## Project Overview
1. **Data Loading**: Import and preprocess the defect images and non defect images.
2. **Model Architecture**: Build a deep learning model using fully connected layers or convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
3. **Training**: Train the model using appropriate optimization techniques.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's accuracy and analyze predictions.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achiving almost 97% accuracy.
